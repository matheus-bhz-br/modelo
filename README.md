Modelo: Intelligent Systems for Connected Living

Modelo is a work-in-progress project that aims to integrate emotional intelligence, contextual decision-making, and home automation into a unified system. By combining local and cloud AI, resilient network architecture, and intelligent automation, Modelo seeks to redefine how we interact with our living environments.

Vision

To create a system that:
	•	Understands and adapts to the user’s emotional state.
	•	Contextualizes environmental, personal, and global information.
	•	Delivers proactive insights and automations that enhance daily life.

Modelo is an experiment in intelligent living, blending technology with emotional and environmental awareness.

Current Development Goals
	1.	Establish a Modular Architecture:
	•	Implement core components using Node-RED, Docker Swarm, and MQTT.
	2.	Build Emotion Detection Capabilities:
	•	Use the HILO module on Raspberry Pi 5 for real-time emotion analysis.
	3.	Integrate Hybrid AI:
	•	Local processing with LLAMA 2.
	•	Fallback to Bloom API for cloud-based inference.
	4.	Automate Contextual Actions:
	•	Develop basic workflows for environmental adjustments and proactive prompts.

Roadmap

Phase 1: Foundation (Current Stage)
	•	Set up core services (Node-RED, Docker Swarm, MQTT).
	•	Develop and test basic emotion detection workflows.
	•	Define data flows for environmental and financial inputs.

Phase 2: Integration
	•	Connect emotional data to contextual automation.
	•	Incorporate local AI processing on Alienware.
	•	Implement fallback mechanisms with Bloom API.

Phase 3: Refinement
	•	Optimize workflows for real-world usage.
	•	Add dashboards for monitoring (e.g., Grafana).
	•	Expand use cases (e.g., advanced financial insights).

Project Status
	•	Stage: Early Development
	•	Focus: Architecture design and initial workflow testing.

How to Contribute

At this stage, contributions are welcome in the form of:
	•	Suggestions for architecture and features.
	•	Discussions about potential use cases and optimizations.
	•	Collaboration on initial workflows or configurations.

If you’re interested, feel free to fork the repository and open a discussion or issue!
